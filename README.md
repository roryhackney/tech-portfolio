# tech-portfolio
My tech portfolio showcases my software, web development, and UX design skills, functioning both as a place to display my projects, experience, and resume, and as a strong portfolio piece itself.

Fully responsive and mobile friendly, built with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bulma. Includes responsive images, a secure contact form, dark and light mode, my resume, education, and experience, past projects, and more.

I recently graduated with my CS degree, and am currently working as a CS, IT, and web development tutor while searching for an entry level role in software or web development. If you're interested in my work, please feel free to contact me via email at roryhackney@gmail.com, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roryhackney/), or my contact form, and check out my resume on my [live site](https://www.roryhackney.com).

Thanks for checking out my work!
