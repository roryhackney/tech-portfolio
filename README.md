Code for my fully responsive and mobile friendly web development and design portfolio, built with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bulma. Includes device friendly images, a secure contact form, dark and light mode, my resume, past projects, and more.

Right now, I'm working on adding more projects, including a shop and art project management website that utilizes my database design work.

I'm also working full time while searching for an entry level career opportunity in web development. If you're interested in my work, please feel free to contact me via email, phone, or my contact form, or check out my resume.

Thanks for checking out my work!
